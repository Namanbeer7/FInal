Task: Implement Vintage-Based Color Gradients in PowerPoint Charts
Context
I'm working on a Streamlit cashflow application that exports PowerPoint presentations. The app has two scenarios:
1. "What If" scenario
2. "Commitment Optimization" scenario
Key Files:
* Main application: cashflow_page.py
* PowerPoint export module: cashflow_ppt_export.py
The Streamlit application successfully displays charts with color gradients using plotnine's scale_alpha() function. I need to replicate this gradient effect in the PowerPoint export functionality.
Objective
Implement color/transparency gradients for vintage years in two PowerPoint charts:
1. Sub-Allocation of Private Markets chart (stacked area chart)
2. NAV Forecast chart (stacked area chart)
Color Gradient Requirements
Base Rule
* Each asset class → Gets a unique base color from the ALADDIN_COLORS palette
* Vintage years within the same asset class → Display as gradient variations of the base color
Gradient Logic
* Older vintages (e.g., vintage = -7) → Darker/More opaque shades of the base color
* Newer vintages (e.g., vintage = -1) → Lighter/More transparent shades of the base color
Example to better explain my task:
Given these data series:
* PE - Corporate - vintage(-7)
* PE - Direct/Co-Investment - vintage(-1)
* PE - Direct/Co-Investment - vintage(-7)
* PE - Secondaries - vintage(-5)
Expected color behavior:
1. PE - Corporate → Gets color #1 (e.g., #00885C)
   * vintage(-7) → Darker shade of #00885C
2. PE - Direct/Co-Investment → Gets color #2 (e.g., #FFCE00)
   * vintage(-7) → Darker shade of #FFCE00 (more opaque)
   * vintage(-1) → Lighter shade of #FFCE00 (more transparent)
3. PE - Secondaries → Gets color #3 (e.g., #FF4713)
   * vintage(-5) → Medium shade of #FF4713

Files to Analyze I will provide: 
1. cashflow_page.py - Contains the Streamlit implementation with the working gradient 
2. cashflow_ppt_export.py - Current PowerPoint export code that needs enhancement 
3. def nav_commitment_sep_plots(...) - Contains streamlit plotline implementation
4. I have added streamlit charts screenshots for better visual understanding as well.
